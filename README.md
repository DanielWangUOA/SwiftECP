Need Shibboleth login on your iOS app but don't want to use a webview? Don't want to deal with XML or read a spec? Use SwiftECP to do the work for you!

SwiftECP is a spec-conformant Shibboleth ECP client for iOS. Simply provide credentials and a Shibboleth-protected resource URL and SwiftECP will hand you a Shibboleth cookie to attach to further requests or inject into a webview.

## Usage

Use the 2.0.0 beta releases if you're using Swift 2.0. For Swift 1.2, use 1.2.2.

```swift
ECP(
    username: "tpthomp",
    password: "Tunnel1.recitalistcu",
    protectedURL: NSURL(
        string: "https://my.clemson.edu/srv/broker/protected/noop.php"
    )!,
    logLevel: .Debug
).login().start { event in
    switch event {

    case let .Next(body):
        // If the request was successful, the protected resource will
        // be available in 'body'. Make sure to implement a mechanism to
        // detect authorization timeouts.
        print("Response body: \(body)")

        // The Shibboleth auth cookie is now stored in the sharedHTTPCookieStorage.
        // Attach this cookie to subsequent requests to protected resources.
        // You can access the cookie with the following code:
        if let cookies = NSHTTPCookieStorage.sharedHTTPCookieStorage().cookies {
            let shibCookie = cookies.filter { (cookie: NSHTTPCookie) in
                cookie.name.rangeOfString("shibsession") != nil
                }[0]
            print(shibCookie)
        }

    case let .Error(error):
        // This is an NSError containing both a user-friendly message and a
        // technical debug message. This can help diagnose problems with your
        // SP, your IdP, or even this library :)

        // User-friendly error message
        print(error.localizedDescription)

        // Technical/debug error message
        print(error.localizedFailureReason)

    default:
        break
    }
}
```

## Test

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

You can test your SP and IdP's ECP configuration by opening the example project and replacing username, password, and protectedURL with your own.

## Installation

SwiftECP is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SwiftECP"
```

## Todo

- Unit and integration tests
