                       Need Shibboleth login on your iOS app but don't want to use a webview? Don't want to deal with XML or read a spec? Use SwiftECP to do the work for you! SwiftECP is a spec-conformant Shibboleth ECP client for iOS. Simply provide credentials and a Shibboleth-protected resource URL and SwiftECP will hand you a Shibboleth cookie to attach to further requests or inject into a webview.
